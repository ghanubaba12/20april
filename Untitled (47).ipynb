    "Q1. What is the KNN algorithm?\n",
    "ans-The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric classification and regression technique in machine learning, which is used to classify objects based on their proximity to other objects in a feature space. In the KNN algorithm, the output is based on the majority vote of the K-nearest neighbors of the input data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the KNN algorithm, K is a user-defined parameter that specifies the number of nearest neighbors to consider. To classify a new data point, the algorithm computes the distance between the data point and each of the training data points in the feature space. Then it selects the K-nearest neighbors and assigns the class label of the majority of the neighbors to the new data point.\n",

    "For example, if we have a dataset with two classes, 'red' and 'green', and a new data point whose features are close to three 'red' data points and two 'green' data points, the KNN algorithm will classify the new data point as 'red'.\n",

    "Odd number selection: Since KNN is based on majority voting, it is recommended to choose an odd value of K to avoid ties.\n",

    "Cross-validation: Another method is to use cross-validation to estimate the performance of the algorithm for different values of K. This involves dividing the dataset into multiple parts and training the algorithm on different subsets of the data. The performance of the algorithm can then be evaluated on a validation set, and the value of K that gives the best performance can be chosen.\n",

    "Q5. What is the curse of dimensionality in KNN?\n",
    "ans-The curse of dimensionality in KNN refers to the problem that arises when dealing with high-dimensional data. As the number of dimensions increases, the data becomes increasingly sparse, and the distance between the nearest neighbors becomes less informative. This can lead to the KNN algorithm's performance deteriorating as the number of dimensions increases, making it less effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",

    "In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between any two points becomes almost the same, making it difficult to determine the nearest neighbors accurately. As the number of dimensions increases, the number of data points required to obtain a representative sample of the data also increases exponentially. Therefore, the KNN algorithm's performance deteriorates as the number of dimensions increases, and it becomes computationally expensive to search for the K-nearest neighbors.\n",

    "KNN imputation: We can use KNN to impute missing values by using the values of the nearest neighbors. This involves finding the K nearest neighbors to the data point with missing values and using their values to impute the missing values. This approach can be more accurate than simple imputation methods, as it takes into account the local structure of the data.\n",

Feature scaling involves transforming the input features to a common scale so that they have similar ranges of values.
